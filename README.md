# 2022-MLS-Assessment


## Summary of Assignment

This repository contains my Machine Learning and Statistics Assessment 2022. It is comprised of three regular tasks and one project on Keras 

I commenced work on this assignment on 5th October 2022 and completed work for the deadline of 7th January 2023.

[See here for the Assignment Instructions 2023](https://github.com/LauraBrogan/2022-MLS-Assessment/blob/main/2223-machine-learning-stats-assessment.pdf)

## Liabries used in this Assignment

I impoted: Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Math, Scipy.Stats, Tensor Flow.

* Matplolib is a Python 20 plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive    enviroments across platforms. 

* NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

* Pandas is an open source, BDS-licenced libary providing high-oerfimance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. 

* Math Python built-in module that you can use for mathematical tasks.{*1*}

* Scipy.Stats This module contains a large number of probability distributions, summary and frequency statistics, correlation functions and   statistical tests, masked statistics, kernel density estimation, quasi-Monte Carlo functionality, and more.{*2*}

* TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of     tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.{*3*}

## Whats contained in the repository
This repository contains the following files:

+ 2223-machine-learning-stats-assessment.pdf - Assignment Instructions
+ Regular Tasks folder which contains 3 Jupyter Notebooks one for each of the tasks that were to be completed - Statistics, Models Parameters. Also in this folder is Math.jpg and fisher-extract-table.JPG which are images used in the statistics-task Notebook.
+ README.md - This document
+ project-anomaly-detection.ipynb -  This the the assessement project notebook on keras.
+ Git Ignore file


## Running the Jupyter Notebook {*4*}
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows):

jupyter notebook This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.

When started, the Jupyter Notebook App can access only files within its start-up folder (including any sub-folder). No configuration is necessary if you place your notebooks in your home folder or subfolders. Otherwise, you need to choose a Jupyter Notebook App start-up folder which will contain all the notebooks.

Download the notebook you want to execute and put it in your notebook folder (or a sub-folder of it).

Then follow these steps:

Launch the Jupyter Notebook App (see previous section). In the Notebook Dashboard navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab. Click on the menu Help -> User Interface Tour for an overview of the Jupyter Notebook App user interface. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All. To restart the kernel (i.e. the computational engine), click on the menu Kernel -> Restart. This can be useful to start over a computation from scratch (e.g. variables are deleted, open files are closed, etcâ€¦).
