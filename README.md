# 2022-MLS-Assessment


## Summary of Assignment

This repository contains my Machine Learning and Statistics Assessment. It is comprised of XXX regular Tasks and one project on Keras 

I commenced work on this assignment on 5th October 2022 and completed work for the deadline of 7th January 2023.

[See here for the Assignment Instructions 2023](https://github.com/LauraBrogan/2022-MLS-Assessment/blob/main/2223-machine-learning-stats-assessment.pdf​)

## Liabries used in this Assignment

I impoted: Matplotlib, ???????????????????

* Matplolib is a Python 20 plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive enviroments across platforms.

## Whats contained in the repository
This repository contains the following files:
+ 2223-machine-learning-stats-assessment.pdf - Assignment Instructions
+ Regular Tasks folder which contains ?  3 Jupyter Notebooks one for each of the tasks that were to be completed - Statistics, Models Parameters. Also in this folder is Math.jpg which is an image used in the Statistics-Task Notebook.
+ README.md - This document
+ Project-Anomaly Detection.ipynb -  This the the assessement project notebook.


## Running the Jupyter Notebook *1*
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows):

jupyter notebook This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.

When started, the Jupyter Notebook App can access only files within its start-up folder (including any sub-folder). No configuration is necessary if you place your notebooks in your home folder or subfolders. Otherwise, you need to choose a Jupyter Notebook App start-up folder which will contain all the notebooks.

Download the notebook you want to execute and put it in your notebook folder (or a sub-folder of it).

Then follow these steps:

Launch the Jupyter Notebook App (see previous section). In the Notebook Dashboard navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab. Click on the menu Help -> User Interface Tour for an overview of the Jupyter Notebook App user interface. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All. To restart the kernel (i.e. the computational engine), click on the menu Kernel -> Restart. This can be useful to start over a computation from scratch (e.g. variables are deleted, open files are closed, etc…).
